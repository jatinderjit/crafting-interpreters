# 1. Introduction

## Challenges

### 1. DSLs used for this book

> There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the [little system I
  cobbled together](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) to write
  and publish this book. What are they?

### 2. Java Setup

> Get a “Hello, world!” program written and running in Java. Set up whatever
  makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger,
  get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.

### 3. C Setup

> Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly
  linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and
  delete items from it. Test them.
